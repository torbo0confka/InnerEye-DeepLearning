# How to Play Burnout Paradise's Big Surf Island on PC
 
Burnout Paradise is one of the most popular racing games of the last decade, but PC players have been missing out on one of its best features: the Big Surf Island DLC. This expansion added a new area to the game's open world, full of ramps, jumps, stunts and challenges. Unfortunately, EA never officially released this DLC for PC, leaving fans disappointed and frustrated.

However, there is a way to play Big Surf Island on PC, thanks to some dedicated modders who have unofficially ported the content to the platform. The mod, called Vanity Pack 2.0.0 beta 7, adds the island plus all of the billboards, vehicles, smash gates, super jumps and online challenges. It also fixes some bugs and adds some new features to the game. The only things missing are the offline events, road names, traffic lights, vehicle traffic and the paint shop.
 
To install the mod, you need to have the original version of Burnout Paradise on Steam (not the remastered one), and download the Vanity Pack installer from [here](https://burnouthints.weebly.com/vanity-pack.html). You also need to create an account on [Burnout Hints](https://burnouthints.weebly.com/) and log in with it in the game. Then, you can launch the game and enjoy Big Surf Island on PC.
 
Note that this mod is not authorized by EA or Criterion Games, and may not work properly or cause issues with your game. Use it at your own risk and discretion. We do not condone accessing this DLC illegally and are simply reporting its existence.
 
If you want to play Big Surf Island on PC with all of its features and without any hassle, you may want to wait for EA to release an official version of the DLC for PC. However, given that the game is almost six years old and EA has been silent about it, this may never happen. In that case, you can try this mod and see if it satisfies your craving for some high-octane racing action on a tropical paradise.
  
Big Surf Island is not the only mod available for Burnout Paradise on PC. There are also other mods that add new cars, skins, features and enhancements to the game. For example, Russian Vanity 2 is a mod that adds some of the cars from the remastered version of the game, as well as some custom ones. It also improves the graphics, physics and sound of the game. You can download it from [here](https://rv2mod.weebly.com/).
 
Another mod that you may want to check out is Burnout Paradise: The Ultimate Box Enhanced. This mod aims to make the game more realistic and challenging, by tweaking the gameplay mechanics, difficulty and AI. It also adds some new events and modes, such as Time Attack, Survival and Eliminator. You can download it from [here](https://www.moddb.com/mods/burnout-paradise-the-ultimate-box-enhanced).
 
With these mods, you can enjoy Burnout Paradise on PC in new and exciting ways. However, you should always backup your game files before installing any mod, and follow the instructions carefully. Some mods may not be compatible with each other or with the latest version of the game. Also, be aware that using mods may affect your online experience and may get you banned from some servers.
